Upgrade Section:
    -Add a simple  upgrade section that allows for spinner of planets, spinner of buildings, upgrade level to, option to level up to max (30 or if highest lib level - Need try catch here for people who do not have lvl 30 / resources / halls). 
    -Separate spinner for glyph buildings / resource buildings / spy buildings / misc buildings
    -Add bottom option for ALL planets (for a 1 click simplicty but ADD a safeguard so people understand what it does 
    quite clearly).
    -Figure out a way to cancel the upgrades via an abort button if the user changes mind
    -Patrick will work on this project, though I shed al responsibility for making it look 'pretty'.
